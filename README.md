# How-to-create-your-own-VPN-server-using-Raspberry-Pi
Virtual Private Network Server can be set up on the Raspberry Pi to provide anonymity and encryption among your data and browsing which safes guard your IP address, protects you from MiTM attacks and hides you from prying eyes. Easy to set up and worth protecting yourself from open internet connections, there are 100's of VPN providers on the market and really cheap for there services, choose one that supports OpenVPN to set up on the Raspberry Pi.

A good way to extend on the VPN Server is to turn the Pi into a TOR/VPN Router which is portable and can be plugged into anywhere, adding extra security when you're out in public. TOR is one of the easiest ways to browse the internet anonymously, but it can be very slow, some users switch between TOR and VPN depending on what tasks they are doing.

The great thing about all of these projects is that tutorials can be found online with step by step instructions and videos covering the installation and configuration of these projects. These are my favorite five projects that you can do with a Raspberry Pi, but there are many more projects our there and new ones emerging constantly! 

First things first...
